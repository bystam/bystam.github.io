Everyone thinks code should be readable. If you were to write a blog post arguing that code should be readable, that would constitute a true [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero)-level cold take.

But people obviously do not agree what "readable" means. I usually say that I think code can be **obectively hard, but subjectively easy to understand**. By that I mean that there are ways to truly obfuscate, misdirect and confuse no matter who decides to read it. But there are fewer ways to design and format your code to please everyones experiences and expectations.

This dualiy is hardly unique to programming or code. It is somewhat obvious that for instance music can be **objectively bad, and subjectively good**. People will disagree on their preferred genre, favorite rapper or whether Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston had the better singing voice - yet we can all agree that both the local teenage cover bands of our youth as well as [Iggy Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop) are just objectively horrendous.

Simply saying "everyone has their own unique preference" and leaving it at that feels a bit like giving up, however. Are there any visible clusters of opinions? Any bigger trends? I have spent some time thinking about at least a few of them.

## 'What it does' vs 'how it works'

The most obvious distinction I have noticed with peoples' preferences is to what extent people crave things to show not only what it does, but **exactly how it does it**. This can be seen when people react to anything "declarative" (which I consider to be a sliding scale. Declarative doesn't have to mean YAML).

### Example `ActiveRecord`

## "Magic"
